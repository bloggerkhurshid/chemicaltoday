<p><strong>Unlock true productivity and reduce risk with smart process control in chemical manufacturing</strong></p>

<p>The Chemical industry today faces numerous business challenges—volatility in the cost of feedstock, a complex regulatory environment, aging infrastructure, a shrinking pool of skilled workers, and more. To navigate these challenges, chemical manufacturers are looking at various ways in which they can accelerate growth through digital transformation, operational efficiency, safety, sustainability and empowered workers. Efficient management of electrical, instrumentation and control systems hold the key to mitigating many of these above-mentioned challenges.</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Market volatility</strong> - Changing prices of feedstock and energy/oil costs pose a risk to the bottom line and can be only partly mitigated by improving efficiency of operations.</li>
  <li><strong>Productivity and fixed asset utilization</strong> – A lot of over capacities in chemical manufacturing have been created in some countries, which results in increased competition and reduced-price levels. Also increased waste in production process, due to ageing infrastructure, puts pressure on costs. There is a need to increase productivity, improve asset utilization and lower costs to fight this intense competition.</li>
  <li><strong>Process Safety and Cybersecurity</strong> – Process and people safety, and a cyber secure manufacturing infrastructure, if compromised, has proven to be fatal in todays connected and competitive chemical manufacturing. The right balance between being productive while maintaining safety and security, can only be achieved by holistic approach aided by technology that is intrinsically safe and secure, and not just has a wrapper of safety and security over traditional system.</li>
  <li><strong>Sustainability and regulatory compliance</strong> - Chemical industries are big consumers of energy and so they are also big contributors to emissions in various forms. Efficient WAGES management can not only make the chemical plant more sustainable and ease compliance with norms but also impact the bottom line directly.</li>
  <li><strong>Workforce effectiveness</strong> - With a large part of experienced chemical manufacturing work force retiring or already retired, chemical industry is facing a challenge of shortage of manpower with right skills. This directly affects productivity and is not helpful in this competitive environment. Disparate systems working in silos, which often is the case in chemical plants, need people with different skills, like electrical specialists, instrumentation specialists, process specialists (sometimes even by plant areas). These people sometimes don’t have enough visibility in other areas to take a holistic decision, that leads to issues like increased downtime.</li>
</ol>

<p>A connected chemical plant securely converges plant floor operations technology with business level information technology converting information into data that helps improve risk mitigation, increase security and ease regulatory compliance. Manufacturers need to adopt right technology in production that can help mitigate the risk to a good extent and pave way for a connected chemical plant.</p>

<p>A unified and analytics enabled <a href="https://www.rockwellautomation.com/en-in/capabilities/process-solutions/process-systems/campaign-process-power.html?utm_source=ThirdParty&amp;utm_medium=Public_Relations&amp;utm_campaign=IA_MultiIndustry_AP_CMP-07572-C1P7R9&amp;utm_content=LP_PP_WOCArticle_IN">smart process control</a> for the plant can result in increased efficiency, reduced risk, greater visibility, cost savings, and enhanced productivity.</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Create the right foundation for digital transformation</strong>:
    <ol type="a">
      <li>A unified platform can enable enterprise-wide insights into KPIs such as energy use, emissions, supply chain and yield, with applications which reduce downtime and maintenance costs, reduce batch cycle time and increase throughput.</li>
      <li>Manufacturing operations management on top of a unified process control can Identify and mitigate process inefficiency and reduce waste.</li>
      <li>With batch performance analytics, you can consistently produce batches within quality specifications; maximize yield and minimize waste.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

<ol start="2">
  <li><strong>Production Optimization</strong>:
    <ol type="a">
      <li>A smart process control system integrates&nbsp;process&nbsp;control, motor control, safety, process instruments and information solutions in one open, scalable architecture, thus reducing Total cost of ownership. A modern process control has libraries to seamlessly integrate different areas and not just process.</li>
      <li>With an advanced process control solution chemical plant can increase throughput, reduce process variability, energy, water consumption and emissions. This goes a long way in reducing wastage that is a big challenge in chemical plants. Smart process control has this embedded in the DCS.</li>
      <li>Asset performance management can monitor the efficiency and reliability of process assets across your enterprise using libraries of asset classes and pre-built models. This results in minimizing unplanned downtime and reducing maintenance costs.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

<ol start="3">
  <li><strong>Safe and Secure operations:</strong>
    <ol type="a">
      <li>Process safety applications often require multiple SIL levels: from SIL 1 through SIL 3 in the same control strategy. You need an effective system that can be scaled to meet these requirements. With an effective process safety solution, you can protect people, the environment, and the integrity of the plant’s equipment.</li>
      <li>To maintain system availability and continued operations you need a modern control system with a Defense in Depth approach for industrial automation system security, designed to meet the needs of chemical process.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

<ol start="4">
  <li><strong>Sustainable Operations</strong>: 
    <p>A smart process control system has seamless connectivity with industrial data ops which uses power, energy and process data coming from devices and equipment through a unified control, and enables the advanced analytics like Energy Management, WAGES management, emissions monitoring etc. This turn data into actionable insights to create high-performance, energy-efficient, cost-effective, net-zero plants, and ensures environmental compliance.</p>
    <p>Unified and smart process control can help in the journey of Decarbonization of chemical operations through process optimization and efficient drive systems.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<ol start="5">
  <li><strong>Workforce enablement:</strong>
    <p>With digital technologies embedded and seamlessly connected to Smart process control through an open and IoT ready network, workforce can be enabled and empowered in more than one ways. This can also solve the impending skills issue in chemical plants. With Generative AI and use of advanced emulation and simulation, workers have a virtual assistant in the entire plant lifecycle. With use of design, operate and maintenance co-pilots and virtual training &amp; commissioning tools the training and troubleshooting time and dependence on experienced workers can be reduced, creating the next generation of smart workforce.</p>
